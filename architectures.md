# Architectures

### By rendering strategy

* **SSR**: Server-Side Rendering - rendering a client-side or universal app to HTML on the server.
* **CSR**: Client-Side Rendering - rendering an app in a browser, generally using the DOM.
* **Rehydration**: “booting up” JavaScript views on the client such that they reuse the server-rendered HTML’s DOM tree and data.
* **Prerendering**: running a client-side application at build time to capture its initial state as static HTML.
